## [Unreleased]

### Added — M0: skeleton and sign-in
- FastAPI server with SQLAlchemy 2 and Alembic (migrations run at startup); SQLite by default,
  PostgreSQL through `DATABASE_URL`.
- React + TypeScript + Vite web UI served by the server: setup, sign-in, request an account,
  set password, Machines and Deployments (empty until M1/M2), Users, My account and sessions,
  Audit log.
- First run: a one-time setup token printed in the log and kept in a 0600 secrets file, or an
  owner from `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
- Accounts with roles admin, operator and user; a protected owner; argon2id passwords with a
  minimum length and a common-password check; admin-created accounts set their own password
  through a one-time link; optional self-registration with admin approval.
- Server-side sessions: sign-out, password change, disabling an account and admin sign-out end
  them immediately; 2 h idle and 7-day absolute limits; per-session sign-out.
- Host check (421), CSRF protection on API writes, per-IP request budget and sign-in backoff that
  never locks an account for good and never signs anyone out.
- Audit log of sign-ins and account changes.
- CI: ruff and pytest on SQLite and PostgreSQL 17, frontend lint, typecheck, tests and build.
